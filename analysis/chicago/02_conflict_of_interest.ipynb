      "Summary:\n",
      "The SHACL validation identified multiple Person nodes connected via schema:relatedTo where the connected persons share the same surname, indicating potential conflicts of interest. These persons often work in different departments and organizations that are contractually related, which raises concerns about impartiality and conflict of interest. It is recommended to review these relationships carefully and take appropriate actions to mitigate conflicts.\n"
