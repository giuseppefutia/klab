      "1. Summary of SHACL Validation Issues:\n",
      "The validation error states: \"The newest license end date must not be before the oldest contract start date.\" This means that for the organizations involved, the latest license expiration date is earlier than the earliest contract start date, which is logically inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How to Fix Each Issue:\n",
      "- Ensure that the license periods cover or extend beyond the contract periods.\n",
      "- Update license end dates to be on or after the earliest contract start date.\n",
      "- Alternatively, adjust contract start dates to be on or before the latest license end date if appropriate.\n",
      "- Review and correct data inconsistencies between contract and license records.\n",

      "5. Prioritized Summary:\n",
      "All affected nodes are organizations with contract records and license records where the license end date is earlier than the contract start date. This violates the business rule that licenses must be valid for the duration of contracts. The organizations include MARTHA SANDERS, KARLA LOVE, WICKER PARK BUCKTOWN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, CHICAGO KIDS COMPANY, DOCK'S, BLAIR THOMAS & COMPANY, COURT THEATRE FUND, JOYOUS YEARS, VANDERCOOK COLLEGE OF MUSIC, STAGE LEFT THEATRE, RICHARD HUNT, LEAH S COWEN, and MICHELLE MCFARLAND-MCDANIELS. The relevant date fields clearly show the license end dates are before the contract start dates, triggering the validation error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation:\n",
      "Review and update license records to ensure their end dates are on or after the earliest contract start date for each organization. Alternatively, verify contract start dates for correctness. This will resolve the SHACL validation violation.\n"
